Propaganda.  From the early wars to the most recent American Presidential election, propaganda has influenced and motivated a diverse audience in both a positive and negative light.  While some advertisements castigate people, companies, and organizations, others highlight successes and achievements.  Billboards on highways are argued to be the most entertaining form of propaganda on the market today, seeing as they captivate drivers and their passengers.

Highway billboards around the city of Philadelphia are a public outcry regarding the injustice throughout the city, particularly on the subject of income inequality.  The purpose of these billboards ranges from brand marketing to company profiles.  But a recent billboard in Center City Philadelphia is one of the first advertisements that directly addresses public figures and the need for more investment in education—a topic that is heavily argued upon in the United States today.  

A public high school teacher has erected a billboard on the I-95 Interstate funded primarily by donations that calls out Philadelphia Mayor Kenney, the city’s School Reform Commission, and Superintendent William Hite.  In the February, George Bezanis, a teacher at Central High School, raised over $5000 in just five days on the gofundme.com page with the hope that these city and school district leaders will give Philadelphia teachers a contract.  Countless members of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers have not received a raise nor a proper contract in 5 years while working in the School District of Philadelphia.[^1]  

Bezanis, along with other public school supporters, has now taken action and organized a billboard advertisement that says:

>Welcome to Philadelphia, where we don’t value our public school children,
5+ years without a raise for our teachers.
With Love, the SRC, Mayor Kenney, Superintendent

The billboard has appeared on the Interstate 95, southbound on the right, at a prime location between the Girard and Central Philadelphia exits.  It was originally planned to be up for four weeks, but as donations continue to pour in, Bezanis and the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers decided to keep it for as long as they can.    

As a Philly native, I have witnessed the countless struggles students face while in the District: the high turnover rate of teachers, the lack of learning resources for the students, and the dangerous location of schools.  However, most public officials and state leaders are more concerned with the larger national issues instead of students’ knowledge or improvement in the classroom.  Just recently, the Senate Education Committee in Harrisburg advanced a bill that permits teachers in Pennsylvania to carry a concealed weapon.[^2]  From my experience as an intern reporter for a nonprofit that covers topics in education, efforts should be more dedicated towards local issues, such as a more accurate budget that focuses on providing a better salary for District teachers, instead of issues that involve teachers “packing heat.”

This type of public shaming towards public officials and state leaders is still ongoing, despite cries of outrage and embarrassment from the district.  The billboard is still up and many people have now opened their eyes to the serious problems within Philadelphia public schools.  

Throughout the years, the city has consequently lost an incredible amount of great educators who left the city to work with better pay in surrounding districts.  What’s more, the newly-appointed Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos strongly advocates school choice and does not believe in public school education.  

So now, how will the children of urban cities, including Philadelphia, receive a proper education to advance and improve their futures, if school districts are unable to pay their teachers and offer support programs?  If these children are the future leaders who will be governing us and making important decisions about our lives, then why aren’t we investing more time into educating and helping them?
