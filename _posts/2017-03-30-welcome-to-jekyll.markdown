Welcome to the Forum Web Archive.

Forum is a magazine written, produced, and published by the students
of Villanova University. The views expressed in Forum do not necessarily
represent the views of Villanova University. Each article, column,
piece or any other written statement is a representation of the author’s
opinion, or, but not necessarily including, Forum staff in general. As
always, we welcome your feedback, responses, and of course, lively
conversation.

“Forum apertus est.”
